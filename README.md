# GANs and CNN Final Exam Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of a final exam, focusing on the implementation and analysis of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective is to develop and compare models for image generation and classification tasks, showcasing the strengths and applications of both GANs and CNNs in the field of deep learning.

## Project Structure

- **GANs:** 
  - Designed a Generative Adversarial Network to generate realistic images from random noise. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator that are trained simultaneously, with the generator aiming to create convincing images and the discriminator trying to distinguish between real and fake images.
- **CNNs:** 
  - Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification, leveraging its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in visual data to accurately classify images into different categories.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Data Handling:**
  - `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for building and training the GAN and CNN models.
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Image Processing:**
  - `OpenCV` or `PIL` for handling image data and performing necessary preprocessing steps.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Metrics such as accuracy, loss, and FID (Frechet Inception Distance) for evaluating GAN performance.

## Methodology

### GAN Development:

- **Generator and Discriminator:**
  - Designed a generator network to create images and a discriminator network to classify images as real or fake.
  
- **Adversarial Training:**
  - Trained the GAN with adversarial loss, where the generator attempts to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator works to correctly identify generated images as fake.

### CNN Development:

- **CNN Architecture:**
  - Built a deep Convolutional Neural Network with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
  
- **Model Training:**
  - Trained the CNN using categorical cross-entropy loss and optimized it with an Adam optimizer.

### Model Evaluation:

- **GAN Evaluation:**
  - Used FID to evaluate the quality of images generated by the GAN.
  
- **CNN Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated the CNN’s performance using accuracy and confusion matrices to assess its classification capabilities.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # For GAN
  generated_image = generator.predict(random_noise)
  
  # For CNN
  predictions = cnn_model.predict(test_images)
  ```

## Results

- **GANs:** The GAN model successfully generated images that, while not perfect, showed clear progression towards realism over the course of training.
- **CNNs:** The CNN model achieved high accuracy in classifying images, demonstrating its effectiveness in feature extraction and classification tasks.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the capabilities of both GANs and CNNs in their respective domains—image generation and classification. The results underscored the importance of model architecture and training strategies in achieving good performance.

## Future Work

- **GANs:**
  - Experiment with different loss functions and architectures to improve the quality of generated images.
  
- **CNNs:**
  - Explore deeper CNN architectures or apply transfer learning to enhance classification accuracy.
  
- **Integration:**
  - Investigate combining GANs and CNNs in tasks like data augmentation or semi-supervised learning.
